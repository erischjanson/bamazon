# bamazon
Node.js and MySQL app


This project is a node command line interface program that allows customers to purchase items from our online retailer Bamazon. 

To begin the order process, please call the bamazonCustomer.js file from within the command line using node.
A list of all available items along with their prices will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the ID of the item you are interested in purchasing. Once you've selected an item, you'll be asked how many units of the item you wish to buy. If we have enough product in stock, you'll receive confirmation of your order along with the total price. If we do not have enough product in stock, we will let you know and allow you to adjust your order accordingly.
