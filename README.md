# bamazon
Node.js and MySQL app


This project is a node command line interface program that allows customers to purchase items from our online retailer Bamazon. It also allows managers to view and update inventory as well as to add new products.


FOR CUSTOMERS:

To begin the order process, please call the bamazonCustomer.js file from within the command line using node.
A list of all available items along with their prices will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the ID of the item you are interested in purchasing. Once you've selected an item, you'll be asked how many units of the item you wish to buy. If we have enough product in stock, you'll receive confirmation of your order along with the total price. If we do not have enough product in stock, we will let you know and allow you to adjust your order accordingly.

FOR MANAGERS:

To begin using the manager's version of the product, please call the bamazonManager.js file from the command line using node. You will be prompted to select which action you'd like to perform and from there, the world (of bamazon) is your oyster!
